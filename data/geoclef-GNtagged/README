A Note to the User

The material in this archive is copyrighted and is subject to the terms and 
conditions of the TREC Information-Retrieval Text Research Collection User 
Agreement, which must be signed in order to obtain a copy of the archive.

This data was obtained from Lexis-Nexis with permission of The Los Angeles
Times.  The data represents a sampling of articles published by the
Los Angeles Times in 1994.  Our thanks to Lexis-Nexis and
the Los Angeles Times for providing the data. 

The format uses a labeled bracketing, expressed in the style of SGML (Standard 
Generalized Markup Language).  The SGML DTD used for verification at NIST is 
included in the archive.  The philosophy in the formatting at NIST has been
to preserve as much of the original structure as possible, but to provide
enough consistency to allow simple decoding of the data.

A sample document from the data is shown below:

 Sarah Beckley has this thing about big games.
 She likes playing in arenas, and she will do almost anything she can to ensure
Brea-Olinda plays in an extra-large building.
 Whether it's a playoff game or a championship game, Beckley has thrived in the
spotlight.
 Her big-game affinity continued Saturday, when she gave her blessing to
Southern California's newest arena by scoring a game-high 17 points and pulling
down a game-high 10 rebounds.
 Her performance was one of the key reasons Brea-Olinda defeated Newport
Harbor, 67-39, to advance to the State championship game Saturday at Oakland
Coliseum Arena.

Every document is bracketed by <DOC> <TOPONYMS>

</DOC> tags and has a unique document 
number, bracketed by <DOCNO> </DOCNO> tags.
The set of tags includes the following (with corresponding end tags,

The dataset has been compressed using the "gzip" utility.
The set of articles from a given date are included in one file
named for that date.  Thus, the file "la031394" contains articles
published on March 13, 1994.

Both as part of the philosophy of leaving the data as close to the original as 
possible, and because it is impossible to check all the data manually, there 
are many "errors" in the data.  These range from errors in the original data, 
such as typographical errors, improper tagging errors, to errors in the 
reformatting done at NIST.  The error-checking has concentrated on allowing 
readability of the data rather than on correcting content.  This means that 
there have been automated checks for control characters, special symbols,
foreign language characters, for correct matching of the begin and end tags, 
and for complete DOC and DOCNO fields.  The types of "errors" remaining include 
fragment sentences, strange formatting around tables or other "non-textual" 
items, misspellings, missing fields (that are generally missing from the data), 
etc.
